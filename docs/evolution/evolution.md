# My Minimalist Evolution

From October 2018 to the present, I have evolved over five and a half years into a true minimalist. This transformation has resulted in fundamental changes to both my life and myself. 

Now, I possess only the essentials needed to guarantee my sustenance and mobility. The spirit of decluttering has been integrated into my daily actions and thought patterns. 

Additionally, I believe minimalists have a distinctive competitive edge in the IT field - adept at writing clear and understandable code and documentation, actively thinking about how to break down tasks and reduce complexity, and inclined to produce interfaces that are both aesthetically minimalist and user-friendly.
