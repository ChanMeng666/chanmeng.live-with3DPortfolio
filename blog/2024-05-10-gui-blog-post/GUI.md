Graphics User Interface (GUI) design is a type of user interface in computer software applications that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators (such as sub-markers, windows, buttons, and menus) rather than through a textual command line approach.

In this blog post, I will be sharing the GUI design that I have created for a project.


# Dashboard Homepage: 

This page includes a user-friendly product showcase with a carousel of featured machinery, filters by category, and a notification panel for reminders, promotions, and alerts.
