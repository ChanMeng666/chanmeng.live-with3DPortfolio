## 2018

The year I left my family home to rent my own place marked the start of my journey. Initially, I indulged in frenzied shopping, eager to turn the rental into a standard cosy haven as depicted in consumerist narratives.

However, within two months, I discovered minimalism and swiftly came to understand, accept, and decide to thoroughly implement it in my life.

## 2019

Throughout this year, I immersed myself in a plethora of books and films related to minimalism, deepening my understanding and practice.

## 2020

In August, I moved to another city for work and life. Thanks to my ongoing minimalist practice, all my belongings fit into one suitcase. In the new city, I rented a bare room and embarked on an even more radical minimalist living experiment.

## 2021

This year, I escalated from minimising physical possessions to also shedding intangibles. For instance, I discarded concerns about others' opinions, gender symbols under societal stereotypes, and anxieties about appearance, body image, and age.

## 2022

I changed my surname this year, thus casting off the decayed tradition of following the father's name and the rigid Chinese clan culture. I also signed a consent form to donate my organs post-mortem, freeing myself from the outdated custom of preserving the physical body after death.

## 2023

In March, I disposed of most of my personal belongings and, with just a backpack and a shopping bag of daily necessities, flew from China to the Philippines to start language classes.

Then, in November, carrying a backpack and a suitcase, I arrived in New Zealand to commence my studies in Computer Science.
